  step_size: 0.5 # Step size for sliding window prediction. The larger it is, the faster but less accurate the prediction. Default: 0.5. Cannot be larger than 1. We recommend the default.

  save_probabilities: False # Set this to export predicted class "probabilities". Required if you want to ensemble multiple configurations.
  continue_prediction: False # Continue an aborted previous prediction (will not overwrite existing files).
